A Power BI Analytics Project for AtliQ Grands

## **1. Project Overview**

AtliQ Grands, a luxury and business hotel chain in India, has experienced a decline in market share due to rising competition and ineffective decision-making. To regain revenue and operational efficiency, the management sought a data-driven BI solution to analyze historical booking, occupancy, and revenue performance.

Five datasets were used (dimensional + fact tables):

* **dim_date:** calendar structure with week numbers and day type
* **dim_hotels:** hotel details including category and city
* **dim_rooms:** room class mapping
* **fact_bookings:** transaction-level booking data (status, revenue, platform, ratings)
* **fact_aggregated_bookings:** daily capacity and successful bookings
